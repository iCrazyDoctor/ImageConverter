<p>
The application loads automatically all images from the c:\data\images folder.
</p>

<p>
The image can be changed with the right and left arrow keys or on the Touch UI, by dragging the image to the left/right.
</p>

<p>
The image can be scaled with the up and down arrow keys or on the Touch UI, by dragging up/down.
</p>

<p>
The image can be rotated with the 1 and 3 keys or on the Touch UI, by drawing a semi-circle that is open to the left/right, or selecting Options -> Rotate.
</p>

<p>
The application automatically follows the orientation of the display. Thus in certain devices you can rotate the application by turning the device to use a different orientation. You can also manually set the fixed orientation for the application by selecting Options -> Change Orientation. However, when the orientation is defined manually, the application keeps that orientation regardless of the display's orientation. The orientation locking is released in application exit.
</p>

<p>
An image from any other location can be viewed by selecting Options -> Open. If a memory card is present on the device, a dialog prompting to choose the memory to be used appears. If the memory 
card is not present, the device memory will be used by default (the contents of the folder C:\Data are shown). If the memory card is selected, the contents of its root folder are shown.
</p>

<p>
The properties of the current image can be viewed by selecting Options -> Image Details.
The image in its current orientation and size can be saved by selecting Options -> Save As. This will trigger a list
of supported image formats to be shown to the user. Choose the preferred format by
selecting it from the list and pressing OK. Then you can name the image. 
</p>

<p>
Note: The file extension will 
be appended automatically to the file name according to the selected image format. 
For example, if you chose the JPEG format and type in a file name "MyImage", the 
file will be named "MyImage.JPEG".
